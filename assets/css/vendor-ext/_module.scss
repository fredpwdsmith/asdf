// #Vendor Extensions
// Use to overide vendor based default styles in which you may have files named exactly after the vendors
// they overwrite. For instance, `vendor-ext/_bulma.scss` is a file containing all
// CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Bulma's default CSS.
// This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.

@import
'vendor-ext/bulma';
