// # Vendors

// Most projects will have a `vendors/` folder containing all the CSS files from external libraries
// and frameworks â€“ Normalize, Bootstrap, Bulma, and so on.

// To overide use `vendor-ext/` in which you may have files named exactly after the vendors
// they overwrite. For instance, `vendor-ext/_bulma.scss` is a file containing all
// CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Bulma's default CSS.
// This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.

@import
'../../../node_modules/bulma/bulma',
'vendor/slick';
